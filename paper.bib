    abstract = "{Each time researchers jointly write an article, a decision must be made about the order in which the authors are listed. There are two main norms for doing so. The vast majority of scientific disciplines use a contribution-based norm, according to which authors who contributed the most are listed first. Very few disciplines, most notably economics, instead resort primarily to the norm of listing authors in alphabetical order. It has been argued that (1) this alphabetical norm gives an unfair advantage to researchers with last name initials early in the alphabet and that (2) researchers are aware of this ‘alphabetical discrimination’ and react strategically to it, for example by avoiding collaborations with multiple authors. This article reviews the empirical literature and finds convincing evidence that alphabetical discrimination exists and that researchers react to it.}",

 abstract = {Is the ability to function as a keystone predator a property of a species or an emergent property of the community? We discussed this question in a temporary-pond community where the broken-striped newt Notophthalmus viridescens dorsalis is known to act as a keystone predator on larval anurans. We independently manipulated the initial density of adult Notophthalmus (two or four) and the presence or absence of one adult Siren intermedia in a set of 20 artificial ponds to determine if this additional predator affected the ability of Notophthalmus to function as a keystone predator. Each pond received a diverse assemblage of larval anuran prey: a spring-breeding assemblage of 275 Rana utricularia, 100 Pseudacris crucifer and 25 Bufo americanus tadpoles, and a summer assemblage of 200 Hyla chrysoscelis and 150 Gastrophryne carolinensis tadpoles. Two additional pond received neither predator, to assay the outcome of competition among the tadpoles. The effect of the salamander Siren on Notophthalmus survival and fecundity depended on the density of Notophthalmus. At low newt density Siren had no effect on survival, but at high newt density competition reduced the survival and growth rates of Notophthalmus. The density of Notophthalmus and the presence of Siren interacted to determine the fecundity of Notophthalmus. At low newt density Siren reduced Notophthalmus reproductive success by preying on larvae. At high newt density Siren indirectly enhanced reproductive success by reducing survival of adults, thus releasing larvae from intraspecific competition and cannibalism. Notophthalmus density had no effect on adult Siren survival or growth rate in this experiment, but other evidence indicates that competition with Notophthalmus reduces the growth rates of Siren. Notophthalmus acted as a keystone predator on the assemblage of spring-breeding anurans; it increased the number of metamorphs of the weak competitor Pseudacris crucifer by releasing them from interspecific competition. Siren preyed on tadpoles in a nonselective manner. An additive model was sufficient to describe the effects of Siren and initial density of Notophthalmus on the structure of the tadpole assemblage. In our system of experimental ponds, the strong interaction between Siren and Notophthalmus density did not extend its effects to lower trophic levels, and the direct and indirect effects of Siren did not alter the role of Notophthalmus as a keystone predator.},

 abstract = {(1) Some examples are illustrated where predators have been shown to concentrate their searching activities in regions of high prey density. (2) A model, based on the changes in turning behaviour seen in many predators after feeding (or parasites after parasitism), is developed to show the expected form of aggregative responses resulting from this behaviour alone. The responses tend to be sigmoid in form when expressed as the time spent by a predator in unit areas of different prey density. (3) A further model is discussed in which predators remain in a unit area of prey provided that a prey is encountered within a critical threshold time. This model also generates responses which are more-or-less sigmoid in form. (4) On the basis of these examples (from observation, experiment and models) a general aggregative response may be characterized by three components: an upper plateau where approximately the same (maximum) time is spent in unit areas of relatively high prey densities; similarly, a lower plateau at relatively low prey densities where a constant minimum time is spent in each area and, thirdly, a transitional region where there is a marked increase in time spent per unit area as prey density increases. (5) The stability properties of models including different types of aggregative response are discussed. These responses vary from simple linear relationships between time spent per unit area and prey density, to more complex responses containing the three components of a general response listed in (4) above. In the first place, the prey are assumed to have an effective rate of increase of approximately unity and to have a strongly clumped distribution (k of negative binomial <<1). These constraints enable a full analytic treatment to be presented. However, the basic findings are also shown to apply when the prey are not so strongly clumped (k = 1) and for the general case where prey reproductive rate can taken any value. (6) Stability is increased when (a) there is a marked difference between the maximum and minimum time spent per unit area, (b) the average prey density falls in the neighbourhood of the transition region where the response to prey density is most marked, (c) the time spent travelling between unit areas of prey is high, (d) the effective prey reproductive rate is reduced and (e) the prey distribution becomes more clumped.},

abstract = {The Hawaiian archipelago is arguably the world’s finest natural laboratory for the study of evolution and patterns of speciation. Arthropods comprise over 75\% of the endemic biota of the Hawaiian Islands and a large proportion belongs to species radiations. We classify patterns of speciation within Hawaiian arthropod lineages into three categories: (i) single representatives of a lineage throughout the islands; (ii) species radiations with either (a) single endemic species on different volcanoes or islands, or (b) multiple species on each volcano or island; and (iii) single widespread species within a radiation of species that exhibits local endemism. A common pattern of phylogeography is that of repeated colonization of new island groups, such that lineages progress down the island chain, with the most ancestral groups (populations or species) on the oldest islands. While great dispersal ability and its subsequent loss are features of many of these taxa, there are a number of mechanisms that underlie diversification. These mechanisms may be genetic, including repeated founder events, hybridization, and sexual selection, or ecological, including shifts in habitat and/or host affiliation. The majority of studies reviewed suggest that natural selection is a primary force of change during the initial diversification of taxa.},

Multi-response permutation procedures (MRPPs) indicated that species composition (woody species density, herbaceous species cover) differed significantly among all treatments (woody: P=0.006; herbaceous: P=0.0001) and between distance classes (woody: P=0.03; herbaceous: P=0.002). The frequency of herbaceous life forms also differed between distance classes (MANOVA: P=0.04), with lianas (P=0.03) and legumes (P=0.008) being more common at greater distances from forest. Soil macronutrients (P, K) were significantly lower in long-term fallows than in use fields due to sequestration by the regenerating vegetation but ammonium nitrogen was significantly lower far from older forests (two-way ANOVA: P<0.05). Despite these differences in vegetation and soil characteristics, there were no significant differences in species diversity (richness, evenness) or vegetation structure (woody density, frequency, basal area) as a function of distance to forest (two-way ANOVA: P>0.05), most likely due to seed inputs from surrounding early successional habitats. This study indicates that changes in landscape structure may influence ecological processes such as succession in fragmented tropical landscapes and underscores the need to reject a conceptualization of the landscape matrix as a featureless, inhospitable habitat in favor of one that recognizes and incorporates the influence of matrix quality and heterogeneity.}

If this assumption were correct, there would be only two outcomes of excess pollen levels: an increase in fruit or seed set, or no increase. However, a substantial minority of the studies reviewed here has found that seed production declines with increased pollen loads, both under experimental and natural conditions. To explain this decrease, we propose the following mechanisms: pollen tube crowding, pollen removal or stigma damage by pollen thieves or pollinators, stigma damage during hand—pollination, application of low—diversity or local pollen, effects of bagging flowers, missed stigma receptivity, and the application of inviable pollen. These mechanisms can be distinguished through more complete and more careful experimental designs and incremental pollen supplementation.},

With just one zero observation (if this observation represents a sampling unit), the whole data set needs to be fudged by adding a value (usually 1) before transformation. 3. Simulating data from a negative binomial distribution, we compared the outcome of fitting models that were transformed in various ways (log, square root) with results from fitting models using quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models to untransformed count data. 4. We found that the transformations performed poorly, except when the dispersion was small and the mean counts were large. The quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models consistently performed well, with little bias. 5. We recommend that count data should not be analysed by log-transforming it, but instead models based on Poisson and negative binomial distributions should be used.},

 abstract = {The concept of scale in human geography has been profoundly transformed over the past 20 years. And yet, despite the insights that both empirical and theoretical research on scale have generated, there is today no consensus on what is meant by the term or how it should be operationalized. In this paper we critique the dominant - hierarchical - conception of scale, arguing it presents a number of problems that cannot be overcome simply by adding on to or integrating with network theorizing. We thereby propose to eliminate scale as a concept in human geography. In its place we offer a different ontology, one that so flattens scale as to render the concept unnecessary. We conclude by addressing some of the political implications of a human geography without scale.},

 abstract = {Tropical reef fishes, along with many benthic invertebrates, have a life cycle that includes a sedentary, bottom-dwelling reproductive phase and a planktonic stage that occurs early in development. The adult benthic populations occupy disjunct, patchy habitats; the extent of gene flow due to dispersal of the planktonic life stage is generally unknown. We investigated dispersal, gene flow, and endemism in eight species of Caribbean reef fishes that varied in two life-history traits that may affect dispersal ability: egg type (pelagic and nonpelagic) and length of planktonic (usually larval) life. Using restriction endonuclease analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we estimated the degree of genetic differentiation among six populations of each of the eight species; these populations came from widely separated locales, occupying both the northern and southern current tracks within the Caribbean. In addition, we calculated mtDNA divergence between two of the study species and their sister taxa in the eastern Pacific. The transisthmian taxa have been isolated from one another for approximately 3 million yr and thus provide a divergence measure against which to assess intra-Caribbean mtDNA distances. Mean sequence divergence observed among conspecific Caribbean mtDNA haplotypes in each of the eight fish species was small, less than 0.7% for all but one species. This level of divergence is roughly one order of magnitude less than mtDNA divergence between Caribbean/eastern Pacific sister taxa. For each of the eight species of fishes, the predominant mtDNA haplotype was widespread in the Caribbean. Populations located in different major surface currents were no more differentiated from one another than populations occupying the same current track. These results suggest that there is considerable gene flow throughout the Caribbean, and that this gene flow has not been constrained by present-day ocean currents. We found statistically significant population subdivision for three Caribbean fish species, though between-population variance accounted for only 8%-17% of the total. Fishes showing population structure were: Stegastes leucostictus (nonpelagic eggs; short planktonic life); Gnatholepis thompsoni (nonpelagic eggs; long planktonic life); and Halichoeres bivittatus (pelagic eggs; short planktonic life). These results suggest that neither egg type nor length of larval life is a simple predictor of geographic structure in reef fish populations.},

The very wide range of olivine and low-Ca pyroxene compositions in comet Wild 2 requires a wide range of formation conditions, probably reflecting very different formation locations in the protoplanetary disk. The restricted compositional ranges of Fe-Ni sulfides, the wide range for silicates, and the absence of hydrous phases indicate that comet Wild 2 experienced little or no aqueous alteration. Less abundant Wild 2 materials include a refractory particle, whose presence appears to require radial transport in the early protoplanetary disk.}

    abstract = { A series of laboratory and field experiments was carried out to determine the effects of gamete dilution on fertilization rates in three species of reef coral. Gametes remained viable for 2 h after spawning, but one species exhibited signs of reduced fertility 3-4 h after spawning. Sperm dilution trials carried out in the laboratory indicated that fertilization reaches a maximum at sperm concentrations of 105-106 per ml, with reduced fertilization occurring at both higher and lower concentrations. Estimates of "fertilization potential" in the field were obtained by exposing eggs to water samples taken from the field at various times and locations following episodes of coral spawning. This sampling program indicated that on nights when only small numbers of coral spawned (minor spawning), the fertilization potential was much lower than on major spawning nights. On major spawning nights, fertilization potential was consistently high just after spawning, but became spatially variable thereafter. The percentage of fertilization in field-collected samples of eggs and embryos just after spawning was also higher during major spawning nights than during minor spawning nights. These measurements indicate that gamete dilution can play an important role in limiting the fertilization of coral eggs in the field during natural spawnings. It follows, therefore that corals are under considerable selective pressure to spawn synchronously in order to generate high gamete concentrations in the water column and thus to maximize the probability of successful fertilization. In addition to spawning in synchrony, corals also minimize the effects of gamete dilution by spawning buoyant gamete bundles that accumulate at the sea surface, and by spawning during periods of low water motion. }

abstract = {Fire regimes influence and are influenced by the structure and composition of plant communities. This complex reciprocal relationship has implications for the success of plant invasions and the subsequent impact of invasive species on native biota. Although much attention has been given to the role of invasive grasses in transforming fire regimes and native plant communities, little is known about the relationship between woody invasive species and fire regime. Despite this, prescribed burning is frequently used for managing invasive woody species. In this study we review relationships between woody exotic plant invasions and fire in invaded ecosystems worldwide. Woody invaders may increase or decrease aspects of the fire regime, including fire frequency, intensity and extent. This is in contrast to grass invaders which almost uniformly increase fire frequency. Woody plant invasion can lead to escape from a grass-fire cycle, but the resulting reduction in fire frequency can sometimes lead to a cycle of rare but more intense fires. Prescribed fires may be a useful management tool for controlling woody exotic invaders in some systems, but they are rarely sufficient to eliminate an invasive species, and a dearth of controlled experiments hampers evaluation of their benefits. Nevertheless, because some woody invaders have fuel properties that differ substantially from native species, understanding and managing the impacts of woody invaders on fire regimes and on prescribed burns should become an important component of resource and biodiversity management.},

abstract = {The implications of alternative disturbance specifications in supply functions have been considered in recent theoretical work but little, if any, empirical evidence has been provided on such specifications. Any empirical investigation of the nature of a supply function disturbance is hampered by considerable uncertainty about the deterministic part of the function. Nevertheless, some progress might be made by considering alternative disturbance specifications in conjunction with a variety of deterministic specifications. Applying this approach to the supply of wheat in southern N.S.W., we find some empirical support for an additive disturbance and, surprisingly, for the use of price, rather than revenue, as an argument In supply functions.},
